### Hello! My name is Jamie Davis. ðŸ‘‹

I am a software quality assurance engineer and developer from Portland, Maine.

- ðŸ”­ I work for DCT Consulting, LLC and am currently helping a local company move their tech stack to the Microsoft cloud.
- ðŸ‘¯ At some point in my career I would like to help a early stage startup rapidly prototype their POC and have an employee number less than 10.
- âš¡In my free time I enjoy hiking, being outdoors.
